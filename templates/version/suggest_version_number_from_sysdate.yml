# Notes:
# 
# At the time this was written, PoshCode/ModuleBuilder's Build-Module function 
# expected a [Version]-compatible string, not a [SemVer]-compatible string.
# 
# Leading 9 is arbitrary integer just to make sure not a leading zero.  
# "ff" is as far as we can go in timestamp formatting 
# without getting an [Int32] conversion error out of ModuleBuilder.
# 
# Per https://github.com/puscasu-ion-daniel/azure-devops-docs/blob/1d67a1d/docs/pipelines/process/set-variables-scripts.md, 
# you have to make sure you don't put any whitespace around the ";isoutput=true."  
# Otherwise it won't properly set the variable the way you thought you named it.
